For the sample cohort over 2 different time period, the students in Post-COVID-19 period were six months older than themselves in Pre-COVID-19 period. 

#2-------------------------##
In order to reduce the confounding factors, we divided the students of each grade into two independent student groups (Pre-COVID-19 vs. Post-COVID-19) according to studentâ€™s birth months: 
1) Pre-COVID-19 group includes students from September 1 to February 28 of next year; and 2) Post-COVID-19 group includes students from March 1 to August 31 (Supplemental Figure S2I). 

Using this method, the students have the matched age for analyzing the COVID-19 influence on myopia between Pre-COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 group in each grade, which contribute to adjust the age or timing biases of six months increasing of Post-COVID-19.

By dividing two independent student groups (pre-COVID-19 vs. Post-COVID-19), we found that samples in each group have matched age. 
Furthermore, we also found other factors including key (key school vs. non-key school), gender (female vs. male), and habitation (urban vs. rural) were matched between pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 group (Response Figure S1). 
These results suggest these two divided student groups are plausible.

Figure Legends:
Response Figure 1. Bar plots showed the precent of risk factors for myopia in pre-COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 group. Note: Risk factors include key (key school vs. non-key school), gender (female vs. male), and habitation (urban vs. rural)
