#2. Abstract
COVID-19 quarantine provides the largest intervention data of myopia progression in schoolchildren. We found grade is an important risk factor rather than age, and six-month behavioral modifications sufficiently change the progression of myopia.

#3. Introduction
Myopia is the most-common cause of visual impairment worldwide1, and younger onset may progress to high myopia 2. Since the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused an unprecedented global pandemic, most nations have imposed various strict containment measures on citizens including limited outdoor activities and school closures to prevent COVID-19 virus spread. COVID-19 quarantine led to billions of students simultaneously experiencing life-altering challenges, which may influence the incidence and/or the worsening of myopia among schoolchildren 3. It is highly valuable to establish COVID-19 intervention model in a real world study to uncover the crucial risk factors of myopia development.

#4. Materials and methods
#4.1 Study design and participants
As part of our ongoing efforts within the Myopic Epidemiology and Intervention Study (MEIS) project, the current survey of refraction-confirmed myopia was conducted among more than one-million schoolchildren in Wenzhou City, Zhejiang Province, China in June 2019, and followed by two examinations in December 2019 and June 2020. To facilitate this comprehensive myopia survey, we developed a semi-automated vision examination, and an information-entry pipeline, the Adolescent Myopia Information Management System (AMIMS), which involves manual inspection of automated refractometry data, automatic data import, and collaboration between clinicians and a statistician.

In June of 2019, a census of 1,305 elementary and high schools encompassing different educational systems (key school and non-key school [i.e., public, sport, and martial arts]) in 11 districts of Wenzhou was conducted. There were 1,060,925 students aged 7 to 18 years recruited at the baseline, including 612,648 elementary school students (grades 1-6 in Chinese education system), 264,661 junior high school students (grades 7-9), and 183,616 senior high school students (grades 10-12).

All students identified in the census were invited to complete a self-administered questionnaire regarding demographic information and their knowledge of myopia. Certified technicians were trained at the Wenzhou Medical University Affiliated Eye Hospital with respect to standard procedures for determining visual acuity (VA) and auto refraction testing. Each school in the district was equipped with an auto refractometer (GoldEye RM-9000) and electronic logarithmic visual chart (GoldEye CM-1900C) by the Wenzhou Municipal Government for assessing the degree of myopia. These resources were utilized by trained technicians to examine all participants.

Among the 1,060,925 students, 18,627 students did not attend the VA and auto refraction testing. Participants with refraction values deemed nonstandard by the optometry staff were also excluded (N = 26,350), as were participants with atypical personal identity information (N = 14,119), resulting in 1,001,749 eligible participants (94.4% of the initial study population) remaining in the study. Subsequently, two follow-up examinations were conducted in December 2019 involving 813,755 students (81.2%) and June 2020 involving 768,492 students (76.7%). It was not possible to follow the remaining participants mainly because they had graduated from high school or refused to participate.

#4.2 Ethics and informed consent
The present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Wenzhou Medical University Affiliated Eye Hospital (approval numbers Wmu191204 and Wmu191205). All procedures were conducted in accordance with institutional/national research committee ethical standards as well as the 1964 Helsinki declaration. Participant completion of the self-administered questionnaire was considered informed consent.
